Command history — actions I ran while diagnosing and fixing the build (chronological):

1) Attempt to build (failed due to Java 11):
   mvn -DskipTests package

2) Tried to install JDK 17 (permission denied in container):
   apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk && export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 && export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH" && java -version && mvn -DskipTests package

3) Checked installed JDKs:
   ls -la /usr/lib/jvm || true

4) Set JAVA_HOME to existing Java 17 and rebuilt (succeeded):
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 && export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH" && java -version && mvn -DskipTests package

5) Start the Spring Boot jar in background and write logs:
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64 && export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH" && nohup java -jar target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar > target/app.log 2>&1 & echo $!

6) Quick check of root endpoint (after start):
   sleep 2 && curl -sS -D - http://localhost:8080/ || true

7) View application startup logs:
   tail -n 200 target/app.log || true

8) Stop the running Spring Boot process (search and kill by jar name):
   pids=$(pgrep -f 'demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' || true)
   if [ -n "$pids" ]; then
     echo "Found PIDs: $pids"
     for p in $pids; do
       kill $p || true
     done
     sleep 2
     for p in $pids; do
       if kill -0 $p 2>/dev/null; then
         echo "PID $p still alive — force killing"
         kill -9 $p || true
       fi
     done
     echo "Final process check:"
     ps -ef | grep demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar | grep -v grep || echo "no running process"
   else
     echo "No running Spring Boot process found"
   fi

9) Verify endpoint is down (after stop):
   curl -sS -D - http://localhost:8080/ || true

10) Inspect shutdown logs:
   tail -n 200 target/app.log || true

Additional repo/file-related commands I suggested (not necessarily executed):
- Show the pom diff:
   git --no-pager diff -- pom.xml

- View the modified pom:
   sed -n '1,240p' pom.xml

- Commit the pom change suggestion:
   git add pom.xml
   git commit -m "Replace incorrect Spring Boot starters with spring-boot-starter-web and spring-boot-starter-test"

Notes:
- I also used the workspace file-editing API to update `pom.xml` (replaced dependencies). The precise XML patch is recorded in the repo change history and can be inspected with the `git diff` command above.
- Some attempted commands (like `apt-get install`) failed due to permission; I left them in this history for completeness.

File location:
- /workspaces/Springboot_App_Copy/COMMAND_HISTORY.txt

Next options I can perform for you:
- Commit the `pom.xml` change and create a Git commit now.
- Save these commands to another format (markdown), or produce a downloadable patch.
- Run any of the listed commands again interactively.
